Udemy Courses Data Analysis
Overview
This repository contains a Python script for analyzing Udemy courses data. The analysis covers various aspects of the dataset, such as course subjects, levels, pricing, popularity, and more. The script utilizes the Pandas library for data manipulation and Matplotlib for data visualization.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook or any other Python environment
Required Python libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from Udemy and is named udemy_courses.csv. The dataset includes information about Udemy courses, such as course title, subject, level, pricing, number of subscribers, reviews, and more.

Analysis Steps
Data Loading: The script loads the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.

Data Cleaning: It checks for missing values, duplicates, and drops any duplicate entries.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Examines the distribution of courses across subjects and levels.
Analyzes the count of paid and free courses.
Investigates the relationship between the number of lectures and course type.
Explores the popularity of courses based on the number of subscribers.
Identifies the most popular courses and those with the highest number of reviews.
Analyzes the relationship between course price and the number of reviews.
Finds the total number of courses related to Python and displays the most popular Python courses.
Examines the distribution of courses posted per year.
Data Visualization: The script uses Matplotlib to create visualizations for better insights into the dataset.
